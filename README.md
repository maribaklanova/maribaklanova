# Maria Baklanova 
## Data Analyst with extensive project experience

## About me...
I'm a Data Analyst based in Singapore. 

My enthusiasm for data, statistics, and quantitative analysis started when I first began managing one of the project activities and as it was a new process I proactively collected data from the information system to quantify and evaluate results and understand trends and areas for improvement. I understood the power of findings supported by measured and verified data and the benefits they provide to our team and organization. Since then I have constantly sought to analyze recorded data to make evidence-based decisions.
