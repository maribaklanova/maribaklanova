## About me...
I'm a Data Analyst based in Singapore. 

My enthusiasm for data, statistics, and quantitative analysis started when I first began managing one of the project activities and as it was a new process I proactively collected data from the information system to quantify and evaluate results and understand trends and areas for improvement. I understood the power of findings supported by measured and verified data and the benefits they provide to our team and organization. Since then I have constantly sought to analyze recorded data to make evidence-based decisions.

The project provides valuable insights into the Singapore residential rental market. 
* Data was collected from official sources s.a. URA API, OneMap API, and https://data.gov.sg.
* Data cleaning and pre-processing steps were taken to address missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
* The analysis focused on rental prices by district, project, neighborhood (planning area), number of bedrooms, and region.
* Data visualization included various plots/charts and a rent-aggregating choropleth map of Singapore.
